**Capability to Verify Credentials and take Informed Decisions**

The verifier plays a crucial role in ensuring the authenticity and validity of the issued credentials. This capability allows individuals or entities, such as employers or educational institutions, to verify the authenticity of a learner's credentials. By leveraging sunbird RC verification services and APIs the verifier can confirm that the credentials have not been tampered with and that they originate from a trusted issuer. Verifiers can use the provided APIs or interfaces to perform real-time verification checks and retrieve the necessary information to make informed decisions.

# What is Skill Passport? Why is it required?

**The Skill Passport contains capabilities of capturing user competencies and 360 degree feedback with an option to integrate with Course Marketplace for skilling and 3rd party assessments for testing progress.**

The skill passport is meant to be a repository of the competencies of a user. It would contain the user’s job roles with requirements, the competency levels achieved till date, along with Self-assessment, End of course(CBP) assessments and Proctored Independent and Authorized Assessment (PIAA) scores and certificates. It would be accessed by employees through a mobile app (developed as part of Compass DPG: https://github.com/compass-core-platform).


The skill passport will take the data related to required competencies, self-assessment, CBP and PIAA scores, from FRAC, PIAA and marketplace modules and will be accessed by the employee on the mobile app. Along with this, WPCAS data will also be displayed which will be taken from the WPCAS module.


The major driver of developing such a module is to enable the users to have a one-stop shop to view and share all their competencies from the same place. This would be useful for users to understand gaps and improve their skills to become more competent professionals. They will also use this feature to share their performance to other necessary stakeholders, like workplaces. The workplaces would be able to verify the authenticity of such documents readily as these documents will have the relevant authority credentials.

# Sample Use Case: Competency Passbook within Compass DPG

To deliver on the goals of providing public goods and services that improve the lives of India’s 1.4 billion citizens, one of the key dimensions in which the Indian state should improve is the management of its people or human resources. As a direct result of this, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) wants to track competencies of human resources as a construct for understanding whether an individual has the attitudes, skills, and knowledge required to perform their role. Competencies can help a department answer the question: given our departmental goals, what attitudes, skills and knowledge should our employees possess to enable them to achieve their goals, and in the process, achieve the department’s goals? 

COMPASS is envisioned as a component of a goal-oriented human resource management system (GO-HRM) that will allow departments to link their goals with well-defined targets for teams and individuals, map competencies required to fulfill these targets, and link capacity to performance management.

COMPASS comprises multiple modules meant to deliver specific functionality. Skill Passport acts as passbook with repository of users competencies.
